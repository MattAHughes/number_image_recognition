# number_image_recognition
A CNN based architecture implemented and designed using Python's TensorFlow2 and Keras and trained on the MNIST dataset.

The model architecture was constructed as an attempt implementing Ahlawat et al. Improved Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Sensors (2020), 20, 3344.

The architecture uses mainly convolutional and max pooling layers with optional dropout.
